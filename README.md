This was a assingment given by our teacher Sir saif ul islam in Introduction to Data Science Course. to test our python skills. And i believe a project like this is really good for practing and testing python skills. 

In this project there were multiple classes (Economy class, Business class, First class) of seats each of the classes having different prices and no of seats.
